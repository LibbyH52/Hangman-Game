# Hangman Game

Simple game of hangman developed for children. It's my first time developing a game solo, so any tips/ suggestions/ constructive criticism are always very much appreciated. I am uploading it as I go along for testing purposes.  

### Features Left to Implement
* Aditional styling and colouring
* Allow user to choose to play again and keep track of games won/ lost
